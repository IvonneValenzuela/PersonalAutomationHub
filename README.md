# 🧩 Playwright Automations — Personal Automation Hub (QA Portfolio)

A small collection of Playwright + TypeScript automations I built to solve real needs in my day-to-day life.

They also work as **QA portfolio pieces**, showcasing:

- Playwright + TypeScript
- Page Object Model (POM)
- Robust locators (role/test-id/aria-friendly)
- Resilient flows (search → match → product detail)
- Environment variables for credentials
- Traces & videos on failures
- Clean, readable test output

## 📌 Automations Included

### 1) 🐱 Cat Store Purchase — End-to-end order flow (Colombia)

Automates a full purchase flow on **https://www.depelos.co/**.

I live abroad and my cats remain in Colombia. This automation helps me order their food and litter reliably on their behalf.

**Spec:**

- `cats-purchase-automation.spec.ts`

**Highlights**

- Login → product selection → cart → checkout
- Dynamic delivery date selection (skips Sundays + Colombian holidays)
- Optional safety flag to avoid placing a real order (`PLACE_ORDER=false`)
- Screenshot + Playwright HTML report attachments

---

📅 Dynamic Delivery Date Logic

The checkout step requires selecting a valid delivery date.
This project automatically computes the next available date that is:

- Not a Sunday
- Not a Colombian public holiday
- Formatted as YYYY-MM-DD

This logic lives in:
common/helpers/date-helper.ts
and uses holiday arrays stored in:
common/helpers/holidays-colombia.ts

### 2) 🛒 Weekly Grocery Price Checker — Woolworths vs New World (NZ)

Compares prices between **Woolworths NZ** and **New World NZ** for the same items.

**Spec:**

- `weekly-price-checker.spec.ts`

**Highlights**

- Searches items in both stores
- Uses match text to open the correct product (more reliable than “first result”)
- Handles cases where New World blocks automation (Cloudflare) by returning `null` and continuing

---

### 3) 🧾 Weekly Woolworths Price Checker — My list, grouped by category (NZ)

Fetches prices for a custom grocery list on **Woolworths NZ**, then prints a grouped summary.

**Spec:**

- `weekly-woolworths-price-checker.spec.ts`

**Highlights**

- Search → open correct product → extract price from product page
- Supports unit labels (e.g. `per kg`, `per ea`, etc.)
- Final output grouped by category + totals

---

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+ (recommended: latest LTS)
- npm
- Playwright browsers

Install:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
```

**🔐 Environment Variables**

- Some tests require credentials. Set the following environment variables before running Cat store test:
- **`CAT_STORE_EMAIL`**: Account email used to sign in
- **`CAT_STORE_PASSWORD`**: Account password

Optional:

PLACE_ORDER=false (default)
Set PLACE_ORDER=true only when you intentionally want to submit a real order.

⚠️ Never commit credentials or .env files to GitHub. Use a separate test account if possible.

---

▶️ Running Tests

Run all tests (headless): npx playwright test
Run a single spec: npx playwright test automations/personal-automations/weekly-price-checker.spec.ts
Open the latest report: npx playwright show-report

### Examples

Run the Woolworths price list checker:

````bash
npx playwright test automations/personal-automations/weekly-woolworths-price-checker.spec.ts

---

**How to run (Windows)**

- **CMD (Windows):**

  ```cmd
  set CAT_STORE_EMAIL=you@example.com && set CAT_STORE_PASSWORD=secret && set PLACE_ORDER=false && npx playwright test
````

- **PowerShell:**

  ```powershell
  $env:CAT_STORE_EMAIL="you@example.com"; $env:CAT_STORE_PASSWORD="secret"; $env:PLACE_ORDER="false"; npx playwright test
  ```

- **Run without placing an actual order:** set `PLACE_ORDER=false` (default). Set `PLACE_ORDER=true` only when you intentionally want the test to submit a real order.

---

⚠️ GitHub Actions / CI Note (Important)

Some automations may pass locally but fail in GitHub Actions.

This is expected for certain retail websites due to:

- Bot protection / anti-automation measures (e.g. Cloudflare)
- IP reputation or geo/network restrictions on CI runners
- Intermittent network issues or rate limiting

Because of this, these automations are primarily intended to be executed locally.

## Trace and video recording are enabled on failures to support debugging and analysis.
